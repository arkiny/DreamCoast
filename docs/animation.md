# glTF animation playback (staged)

Status: **Stage A in progress** (node TRS). Stages B/C follow.

The engine imports glTF scenes into the ECS as a `LocalTransform` hierarchy
(`instantiate_gltf`) and already drives per-frame motion through that hierarchy
(`Spin` + `advance_spin` → `propagate_transforms_parallel` → `build_scene`). glTF
animation is the **general case of that same loop**: instead of a constant angular
velocity, sample authored keyframe tracks each fixed step and write the result into
the targeted nodes' `LocalTransform`. No renderer change is needed for node
animation — the existing draw path picks up the moved transforms.

CC0 test assets (fetched by `tools/fetch-assets.sh`): **AnimatedCube**,
**InterpolationTest** (node TRS + all 3 interpolation modes), **SimpleSkin** (the
minimal vertex skin), **AnimatedMorphCube** (morph targets).

Drive it: `SCENE_GLTF=<path>` imports the glTF as the ECS scene; `GLTF_ANIM[=<i>]`
plays clip `i` (default 0). Headless determinism: the fixed-timestep / capture-seq
path advances one deterministic step per frame (exactly like `P15_SPIN`), so
`CAPTURE_SEQ=N` dumps a reproducible motion sequence. Default (no `GLTF_ANIM`) is a
no-op → byte-identical.

## Stages

### Stage A — node TRS animation (this doc) — in progress
Translate/Rotate/Scale tracks on nodes. No vertex-format change, no shader change.
- **`crates/asset` (`gltf_scene.rs`):** parse `doc.animations()` into
  `GltfScene.animations: Vec<GltfAnimation>`. Each channel = target node index +
  TRS property + sampler (interpolation + input times + typed outputs). Morph-weight
  channels are skipped here (Stage C). Pure CPU data, additive.
- **`crates/scene` (`animation.rs`):** an `AnimationClip` (channels resolved to
  target entities) + an `AnimationPlayer` component (`{ clip, time, speed }`) + a
  sampler (`Step` / `Linear` (slerp for rotation) / `CubicSpline` Hermite) +
  `advance_animation(world, dt)` — the `advance_spin` analogue: advance each player's
  clock (looping `mod duration`), sample every channel, write the target's
  `LocalTransform` T/R/S. CPU-only, no backend touch → no cross-backend risk; unit
  tested (sampler values, determinism, looping).
- **`gltf_instance.rs`:** add `instantiate_gltf_mapped` returning the node-index →
  entity map so a clip's channels can be resolved to entities.
- **`apps/sandbox`:** in the `SCENE_GLTF` branch, build clips from
  `gscene.animations` + the node map and attach an `AnimationPlayer`; call
  `advance_animation` next to `advance_spin` in the frame loop.

### Stage B — vertex skinning — **CPU skinning (B.1) DONE on Metal**

Verified: `SCENE_GLTF=assets/SimpleSkin/SimpleSkin.gltf GLTF_ANIM=0 CAPTURE_SEQ=8
CAPTURE_SEQ_STEP=0` — the column visibly deforms (frames differ) and is run-to-run
identical (deterministic); default capture byte-identical (`b9778dcc`); clippy/fmt
clean. Skinning runs on the inline path only (the per-frame vertex write relies on
the frame-start fence wait; skinned + `P15_RHI_THREAD` is skipped). Implementation
below.

The backend vertex layout is a fixed enum (`pos/normal/uv`, stride 32) defined per
backend; a GPU skinning path would change that layout + the g-buffer/shadow shaders
across all three backends — high cross-backend risk, Metal-only verifiable here. So
**Stage B.1 skins on the CPU**, leaving the GPU vertex format, pipelines, and shaders
**unchanged** (→ zero parity risk, no Windows gate, non-skinned output byte-identical):

- **`crates/asset`:** parse per-vertex `JOINTS_0` + `WEIGHTS_0` onto `GltfPrimitive`
  (kept *off* the GPU `MeshVertex` — CPU-only side data) and `gltf::skin` →
  `GltfSkin { joints: Vec<node_idx>, inverse_bind: Vec<Mat4> }`; `GltfNode.skin`.
- **`crates/scene`:** a `SkinnedMesh` component (bind-pose pos/normal + joints/weights
  + the skin's joint entities + inverse-bind) + `skin_meshes(world)` run after
  `propagate_transforms`: build the palette `joint_world × inverse_bind` and write the
  CPU-skinned pos/normal (`Σ wᵢ · paletteᵢ · v`) into a per-mesh vertex buffer. Skinned
  vertices land in skeleton/scene space, so the drawable's model matrix is the scene
  root (the mesh node's own transform is ignored, per glTF).
- **`apps/sandbox` + registry:** skinned meshes get a host-writable vertex buffer
  re-uploaded each frame from the skinned output; the existing g-buffer pipeline draws
  them unchanged. Driven by the existing `advance_animation` (the joints are ordinary
  animated nodes).

Test: **SimpleSkin** (the mesh visibly bends), then CC-BY characters (Fox /
CesiumMan / RiggedFigure, attribution-tracked). **Stage B.2 (later, optional):** move
skinning to the GPU (skinned vertex layout + joint-palette SSBO + skinning vertex
shader) as a perf optimization — that one takes the full DX≡VK gate.

### Stage C — morph targets (optional)
Morph-weight channels → weighted sum of position/normal deltas. Test:
**AnimatedMorphCube**.

## Parallelization on the job system (planned)

Animation work is CPU-heavy and embarrassingly parallel, so it should be distributed
across `dreamcoast_jobs` workers — the same pattern as `propagate_transforms_parallel`
(Phase 15 M3) and the M4 B4 parallel render-graph recording (`jobs.parallel_for`,
deterministic = bit-identical to the sequential run). Done as an opt-in optimization
once the single-threaded path is correct; **determinism (and the headless
byte-identical capture) must be preserved** — every parallelized unit stays a pure
function of immutable snapshots, like `resolve_world`. Targets, cheapest-to-richest:

1. **CPU skinning (`skin_and_upload`) — the prime target.** The per-vertex LBS deform
   (`Σ wᵢ · paletteᵢ · v` + normal) is the dominant cost and fully independent per
   vertex. Build each mesh's palette (small, sequential), then `parallel_for` over the
   vertex range writing into the disjoint `out` slots; the `vbuf.write` upload stays
   sequential. Multiple skinned meshes can also parallelize across meshes. Pure per
   vertex → bit-identical to the serial loop. (When GPU skinning (B.2) lands it
   subsumes this; until then CPU skinning is the main per-frame animation cost.)
2. **Animation sampling (`advance_animation`).** Players/channels are independent; the
   sample pass (read clips → compute the TRS writes) parallelizes over players, with
   the `LocalTransform`/clock write-back applied sequentially (the two-pass shape it
   already has, mirroring `advance_spin`). Lower priority — sampling is cheap next to
   skinning until clip/joint counts get large.
3. **Transform propagation** is already parallel (`propagate_transforms_parallel`).

The natural end state is a per-frame animation stage on the job graph: sample (∥ over
players) → propagate (∥, existing) → skin (∥ over vertices) → build draw list. Fits the
fixed-timestep loop and stays deterministic.

## Verification (per stage)
- Unit tests for the parser + sampler (deterministic, interpolation modes).
- Headless: `SCENE_GLTF=… GLTF_ANIM=0 CAPTURE_SEQ=4` → frames differ (motion) AND
  run-to-run identical (deterministic), like the `P15_SPIN` sequence.
- Default capture byte-identical (`b9778dcc`) — animation is opt-in.
- Any job-system parallelization must stay **bit-identical** to the serial path
  (snapshot → pure parallel compute → sequential write-back).
- Metal verified here; VK/DX parity pending (Stage A is CPU-only → low risk; Stage B
  touches shaders → full DX≡VK gate).
